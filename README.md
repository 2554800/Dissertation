Generating Insight from Product Reviews

This project aims to analyze customer product reviews to extract actionable insights that enhance decision-making. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis, we will identify key trends, customer sentiments, and recurring themes in feedback. The goal is to uncover strengths, pain points, and improvement opportunities to inform product development, marketing strategies, and customer experience enhancements. Data will be sourced from multiple review platforms, cleaned, and processed to generate structured insights. Deliverables include a dashboard, summary reports, and recommendations based on key findings. The project will drive data-informed decisions to improve product offerings and customer satisfaction.
